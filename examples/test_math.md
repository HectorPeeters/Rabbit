This is a simple number

$$ 124 $$

This is a more advanced function

$$ \frac{12x}{\sqrt{54}} $$

And even integrals!

$$ \int\limits_{-1}^{1}x^2 dx $$

Even $ \sqrt{12} $ inline math works but isn't technically supported!

This is some longer text to test if it interferes with the math. Lets make this text even longer!

$$ \sum_{i=1}^10 x_i $$
